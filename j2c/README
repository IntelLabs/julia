First, you need to set JULIA_ROOT environment to the full path to this
directory. This is where j2c output file, and object file will be stored.

To run J2C example, go to the julia/test directory, run:

  ../julia j2c.jl

It should finish without any error. Check julia/j2c directory for the 
intermediate files during J2C compilation.
